The Rules:
You roll 2 regular dices. 
After the dices have come to rest, the sum of them
is calculated.
If the sum is 7 or 11 on the first roll- You Win!
If the sum is 2, 3 or 12 on the first roll - You Lose!
If the sum is anything else, the sum becomes your
point.
To win you must keep rolling until you "make your
point" (i.e, roll the same point value).
If you roll 7 before making yout point-You Lose!
